# OpenDSE - Open Design Space Exploration Framework
	
_OpenDSE_ is a design space exploration framework for embedded systems, written in Java. 
It follows the Y-chart approach where an application consisting of data-dependent tasks is mapped to an architecture consisting of resources.

The documentation of the framework is based on a tutorial, javadocs, and source code. Learn how to use OpenDSE from the following links:

*   A tutorial shows the basic model, XML and optimization.
*   The Javadocs give an overview of the structure of the framework and its elements.

## History

_OpenDSE_ was formerly hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/opendse/
