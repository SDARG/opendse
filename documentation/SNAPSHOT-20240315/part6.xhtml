	<p>
	For each specification, an optimization can be carried out.
	The optimization can be started by running the main method of the Opt4J class:</p>

	<p>The optimization has to be properly configured by selecting the modules as illustrated. 
	Additionally, it is necessary to select an input file which we set to <a href="#optimizationfile">this file</a>.
	We optimize a single objective which are the costs.
	It is possible to implement any kind of evaluator, including non-linear objectives. 
	Furthermore, it is possible to use external evaluators, i.e., programs that receive the respective implementation as XML and return their result as XML. </p>

	The exploration delivers after a few iterations the optimal solution: </p>
